Ex 1. A simple parser (output: yes/no)
a) What is the language generated by the following grammar?

Answer: The language generated by this grammar is one which can generate arithmetic operations (with its terms between parentheses if desired) with plus(+) and product(*) operators with the terminals characters a, b, c & d. (Whereas not very relevant, it is also possible to generate uniquely the terminal characters)

Examples of the descripted language: 
( a + b * c ) * ( c * a ) + b + d
( c * b ) + a*c 
a
b
